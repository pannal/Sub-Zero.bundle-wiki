# Store as metadata or on filesystem

By default, Plex stores posters, fan art and subtitles as metadata in a separate folder which is not managed by the user. In Sub-Zero, though, `Store subtitles next to media files` is enabled by default. The agent will write the subtitle files in the media folder next to the media file itself. The setting `Subtitle folder` configures in which folder (current folder or other subfolder) the subtitles are stored. The expert user can also supply `Custom Subtitle folder` which can also be an absolute path.

~~When a subfolder (either custom or predefined) is used, the automatic scheduled refresh of Plex won't pick up your subtitles, **only** a manual refresh will!~~ This should not be true anymore.
