## Installation:
In order to allow your development to not be overwritten automatically by the Plex Media Server, you should follow the following installation procedure:

### Manual/Development/Testing Installation

* go to Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
* rm -r Sub-Zero.bundle (remove the folder if it already exists) (If running windows, simply delete the directory from explore)
* get the release you want from [https://github.com/pannal/Sub-Zero.bundle/releases/](https://github.com/pannal/Sub-Zero.bundle/releases/)
* unzip the release into Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
* edit Contents/Info.plist and set <key>PlexPluginDevMode</key>'s value to <string>1</string> to avoid automatic updates with the stable release to your manual installation
* restart your plex media server!!!
