When selecting a media, while like browsing a library from Sub-Zero, you are presented with the following menu:

![Media](https://github.com/pannal/Sub-Zero.bundle/blob/master/Wiki/Images/Item_1.png) 

1. On Deck Items
 * Here you see the medias that are On Deck (returned by the Plex API), allowing you to:
    - Refresh the item, in order to maybe pick up a missing subtitle
    - Force Refresh, Ignoring all subs, and go hunt for them again
    - Add the media to the internal [Ignore list](#ignore), meaning that Sub-Zero will not process that media again
2. Items with missing subtitles
 * Here you search for items considered recent (See the [[Sub‐Zero Configuration|Sub‐Zero-Configuration]] menu)
   - you can then select the individual medias, and select between the medias as on above
