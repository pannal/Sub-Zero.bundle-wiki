Sub-Zero is a Metadata agent, that will download subtitles automatically for your movies and TV-Shows, but where it differs from other agents out there, is that it not only can search multiple sites for the best match, but also has a build in scheduler and a graphical interface for manual operations.  

Sub-Zero is based on [Subliminal](https://github.com/bramwalet/Subliminal.bundle). 
Sub-Zero will search on the following sites for the best matching subtitles:

* OpenSubtitles
* ~~TheSubDB~~
* Podnapisi.NET
* Addic7ed
* TVsubtitles.net

All providers can be disabled or enabled on a per provider setting. Certain preferences change the behaviour of subliminal, for instance the minimum score of subtitles to download, or whether to download hearing impaired subtitles or not. The agent stores the subtitles as metadata, but can be [[configured|Configuration#wiki-store]] to store it next to the media files.
